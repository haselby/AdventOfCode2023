AOD 2023 Day 2 Observations

List of Games

Each game has an ID  (Note: not zero based)
Each game consist of set of cubes.  (Note: probably used SET as a hint for ideal data types)
Set are unordered. Meaning color tags are in no specific order.
Also there are cases where not all color are present.


The Elf would first like to know which games would have been possible if the bag contained only 12 red cubes, 13 green cubes, and 14 blue cubes?

My guess is that RGB set is a refence to an RGB color value.

This is a max number of cube types is a set its own right.


List of Games

Game is an ID with and a list of setsOfCubes

setsOfCubes contain integer values for R, G, B


It is probably best to encode this structure during the PuzzleInput

Puzzle Method that reads input text file would return this type

ArrayList<Games>

Games is a int, ArrayList<setOfRGBCubes>

setOfRGBCubes set of integers R = red, G = green, B = blue

SetofRGBCubes

SetofRGBCubes setOfRGBCubes = new setOfRGBCubes(0,0,0)

setOfRGBCubes.setBlue = 3
setOfRGBCubes.setRed = 4
Game.addSetOfCubes = setOFRGBCubes


Game could have a function that calculates total number of RGBCubes

In this case it would be nice to make RGBCubes class more general so that it can be used for both
sets of RGB Cubes and Total number of RGB Cubes

RGBCubes <-- This might be a good class name. 

It would also be nice to have an RGB method that adds RGB value from another RGB Object (adding it to a running sum)
